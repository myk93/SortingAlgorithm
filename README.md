# Sorting Algorithm Visualization
This project is a C# application that provides a visual representation of multiple sorting algorithms using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the user interface.

Sorting Algorithm Visualization is a project aimed at helping developers understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive user interface that allows users to observe the step-by-step execution of different sorting algorithms on a set of randomly generated data.

## Features
Visualization of the following sorting algorithms:

`Bubble Sort`
`Selection Sort`
`Insertion Sort`
`Merge Sort`
`Quick Sort`
`Cocktail Sort`
`Shell Sort`
`Bucket Sort`
`Radix Sort`
Random data generation: Users can specify the number of elements and range for the data to be sorted.

###Step-by-step visualization:
The application animates the sorting process step by step, providing visual cues and highlighting the elements being compared and swapped.

## Technologies
The project is built using the following technologies:

`C# programming language`
`MVVM architectural pattern`
`WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the user interface`
`.NET Framework`

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/myk93/SortingAlgorithm.git
```
Open the solution file SortingAlgorithm.sln in Visual Studio.

Build the solution to restore the NuGet packages and compile the project.

## Usage
Launch the application from Visual Studio or by running the compiled executable.

Specify the number of elements and the range for the data to be sorted.


Click the "shuffle" button then "sort" to begin the visualization.
